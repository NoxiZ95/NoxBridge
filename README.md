# NoxBridge

**NoxBridge** is a lightweight and user-friendly SSH client that provides seamless access to both the terminal and file system of a remote server â€” all in one place.

### ðŸ§© Key Features
- ðŸ”’ **Secure & stable SSH connection**
- ðŸ’¬ **Integrated console access** for direct server interaction
- ðŸ“‚ **File management** (upload & download)
- ðŸ§¼ **Clean and focused UI**, free of unnecessary complexity

### ðŸ’¡ Why NoxBridge?

Many SSH clients require you to use separate tools for terminal access (`cmd`, `PuTTY`) and file transfers (`WinSCP`).  
NoxBridge combines both into a single streamlined interface â€” especially valuable when working with headless (non-GUI) Linux servers where the terminal is your primary interaction point.

Whether you're maintaining a remote system or managing deployments, NoxBridge helps you stay efficient and focused.
